API:
  ☐ Define and implement a `@behaviour` for each union-case (necessary for external module definitions)

Quality of Life:
  ☐ Figure out a way to derive protocol implementations for union structs (e.g. for `Jason`)

Explore: @idea
  ☐ Allow to pass "external" module to define a single case
  ☐ Single case definitions (to be able to use it as value-type)
